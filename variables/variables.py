# Mutability in Python refers to whether an object can be changed after it is created.
# Mutable objects can be modified, while immutable objects cannot be changed.
# Numeric types in Python are generally immutable, meaning once a numeric value is assigned to a variable

# Dynamic typing in Python means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime, allowing for flexibility in variable assignments.
# Numeric types can be reassigned to different values, but the original value remains unchanged.
# For example, if you assign an integer to a variable and then reassign it to a float, the variable's type changes dynamically.
# This allows for easy manipulation of numeric values without the

# local and global scope in Python refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables within different parts of a program.
# Local variables are defined within a function and can only be accessed within that function.
# Global variables are defined outside of any function and can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
# Numeric types can be used as local or global variables, depending on where they are defined.
# For example, if you define a numeric variable inside a function, it is local to that function and cannot be accessed outside of it.
# If you define a numeric variable outside of any function, it is global and can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
# This allows for flexibility in variable usage and helps manage the scope of numeric values in Python programs.
# Understanding local and global scope
# is essential for writing efficient and organized code, especially when dealing with numeric types and their operations
# in different parts of a program.
# Numeric types can be used in both local and global scopes, allowing for flexibility in variable usage     


# Naming rules in Python refer to the conventions and restrictions for naming variables, functions, classes, and other identifiers.
# Numeric types can be assigned to variables following these naming rules.
# Variable names must start with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, numbers, or underscores
# Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning 'myVariable' and 'myvariable' are considered different variables.
# Variable names cannot be the same as Python keywords, such as 'if', 'else', 'while', 'for', etc.
# Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful, reflecting the purpose of the variable.
# Numeric types can be named using these rules, such as 'my_integer', 'my_float', or 'my_complex'.
# Following these naming rules helps improve code readability
# and maintainability, making it easier for developers to understand the purpose of each variable.
# Numeric types can be used in various contexts, such as mathematical operations, data analysis, and scientific computing.
# By adhering to naming conventions, developers can create clear and concise code that is easy to read
# and understand, especially when working with numeric types and their operations.
